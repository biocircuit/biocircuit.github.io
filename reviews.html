        <p class="review-entry">
   “Ghost in the Shell” presents a post-human vision of the future in which humans have merged with machines, either partially or entirely. The central question explored throughout the series concerns identity and consciousness—specifically, what these concepts mean in a world where the line between human and machine has blurred. The main protagonist, Motoko Kusanagi, exemplifies this gradual process of cyberization. Originally a “full” human, she suffers a catastrophic accident in childhood that forces her to transfer into a completely cybernetic body, leaving only her biological brain intact. Even that final remnant is eventually relinquished when she fuses with the Puppet Master, a self-aware artificial intelligence accidentally created by the government.
<br> The plot follows the operations of Section 9, a public security and counter-cyberterrorism unit led by Major Kusanagi. While the series initially seems episodic—featuring various cyber-crimes and terrorist threats—these cases share underlying patterns that ultimately point to the enigmatic hacker known as the Puppet Master.
<br> I highly recommend Ghost in the Shell to anyone interested in post-humanist ideas or the philosophical possibilities of cybernetics. Beyond its striking aesthetics, what I find particularly compelling is the biomedical dimension of its post-human philosophy. The series’ exploration of bodily augmentation and the interplay between biology and machinery forms the core of its thematic power.
<br> The manga also incorporates several religious and philosophical motifs, especially from Buddhism, such as the interconnection of all phenomena and the notion of the ego as a fluid, non-fixed identity. At one point Motoko remarks, “All I am is data running on biological hardware,” suggesting that identity is an aggregation of information rather than a permanent essence—an idea closely aligned with Buddhist thought. For readers with spiritual or philosophical interests, these elements add a fascinating layer of nuance.
<br> In my view, Ghost in the Shell is one of the best manga ever created and among the most intellectually stimulating graphic novels—arguably surpassed only by the works of Alan Moore. Its creator, Masamune Shirow, is a true “renaissance man”: not only a talented illustrator and designer, but also deeply knowledgeable in scientific, philosophical, and engineering concepts. This mastery is evident not just in Ghost in the Shell but also in his other works, such as Appleseed and New Dominion Tank Police, which I intend to discuss in future posts.

        <h2 class="review-title">An Open Letter to Open-Minded Progressives</h2>
        <h3 class="review-author">Mencius Moldbug</h3>
        <p class="review-entry">
            „An Open Letter to Open-Minded Progressives” is one of the first pieces of writing that Curtis Yarvin a.k.a. Mencius Moldbug put on his influential blog „Unqualified Reservations”. „Open Letter” is a form of manifesto in which Moldbug criticizes democratic system of governance and tries to dismantle its core beliefs while giving an alternative solution, known as neo-cameralism.
<br> Neocameralism at its core revolves around the idea of centering the political power around a single ruler, known as the „Receiver”. The Receiver has absolute power over the state and is only controlled by a group of appointed corporate style trustees, who oversee that the Receiver’s actions produce profit for the state. The trustees are also responsible for removing the receiver from the office if the state suffers loses. As for the citizens of the state themselves, they are treated like companie’s shareholders and participate in the profit produced by the state.
<br> Well then, one could ask – what is the difference between a neo-cameralist and a welfare state in which everybody participates in the profit produced? The difference is that in the neo-cameralist state the political power is not affected by the public opinion. Public opinion, according to Moldbug is an obstacle to the effective rule, since among others it creates lobbyists, coteries, cliques and other groups of influence that distort effective rule.
<br> I would sincerely invite you to read the „Open Letter” yourself (it's free to download from Curtis Yarvin's blog), as I’m by no means a political expert, so misrepresentations of the topic at hand can occur. It is also worth to note that Moldbugs „Open Letter” is only an intro to the subject and to understand fully the topic at hand it would be advisable to go through Yarvin’s other books as well, perhaps also read authors like Thomas Carlyle or Nick Land, who share a similar neocameralist approach.
